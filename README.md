# THIS IS NOW DEPRECIATED.
This iteration of STAR_BOT is now incompatable with Discord. I will upload a fix shortly.

# THIS IS A FRAMEWORK FOR SOMEONE NEW TO JAVASCRIPT/DISCORD BOTTING.
To use this, I would first rename auth.json.example to auth.json. Get sublime or whatever IDE you use, open it up, and fill in your account details.
The only included commands are Ping and Pong. I left some hints in the code to help you get started.
# Good luck!
